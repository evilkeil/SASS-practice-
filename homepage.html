      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to share my creative journey with you. My name is [Your Name], and I recently graduated from the prestigious Tokyo Design Technology Center. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and SCSS, I'm passionate about crafting unique and engaging web experiences.

      Throughout my academic career, I've honed my skills in designing and building user-friendly websites that are both visually appealing and functional. From wireframing and prototyping to coding and testing, I'm well-versed in the entire web development process.</p>

      <p class="mt-1">I believe that great design is not only about aesthetics but also about creating seamless user experiences. I'm constantly exploring new ways to push the boundaries of web development and create innovative solutions that captivate users and leave a lasting impression.

      Whether it's a personal project or a collaborative effort, I'm always up for new challenges and eager to apply my skills to create exceptional web experiences. I'm excited to share my work with you and showcase my passion for web development. Let's connect and embark on this creative journey together!</p>
